Please find attached the student's proposal on how he expects to approach the challenge (file: proposal.pdf). Please mind that sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 contain generic information regarding the dataset and the competition that were obtained in part from the Kaggle competition's website. Remaining sections are original content. Section 7 is specifically focused on elaborating a method on how to solve the challenge posed by the Kaggle competition.
