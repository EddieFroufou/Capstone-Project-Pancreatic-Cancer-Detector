# Capstone-Project-Pancreatic-Cancer-Detector

This project is from a Kaggle challenge. Information and data for this challenge (and therefore this project) can be found in the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/overview

Please find attached the student's proposal on how he expects to approach the challenge (file: proposal.pdf). Please mind that sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 contain generic information regarding the dataset and the competition that were obtained in part from the Kaggle competition's website. Remaining sections are original content. Section 7 is specifically focused on how to solve the challenge.

## How to browse this repetoire:

See how I participated in the kaggle competition by reading my "Capstone project memoire" PDF file. For more background on the project, please read the PDF document named "proposal".

In the end, in spite of achieving 97.9% accuracy scores on my validation dataset, my submissions generated a maximimum score of 76.7, which implies a 33rd percentile in the public leaderboard. If I had had more time, I would have retrained the last version of my model with larger augmented images (ideally, 64x(256x256), currently using 16x(128x128), much less information).
